# Task: Add Concurrency Safeguards for Database Writes

## Objective
Implement locking and conflict detection to prevent data corruption when multiple processes or sessions write to the database concurrently.

## Key Deliverables
- Assessment of current concurrency risks and desired safety guarantees.
- Implementation of file/advisory locks around write operations.
- Conflict detection for `node.edit` (e.g., optimistic concurrency control).
- Documentation describing concurrency model and guidelines for users.
- Tests simulating concurrent operations to verify safeguards.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Analysis**
   - Review existing database access patterns and identify critical write paths.
2. **Design**
   - Choose locking strategy (file locks, advisory locks, or DB-level mechanisms).
   - Define conflict resolution approach for edits (version numbers, timestamps).
3. **Implementation**
   - Integrate locking into persistence layer and ensure cross-platform compatibility.
   - Update `node.edit` to surface conflicts and guide users through resolution.
4. **Testing**
   - Write concurrency tests (possibly using worker threads) to stress locking behavior.
5. **Documentation**
   - Update docs to explain how concurrency is handled and any configuration knobs.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Locking must work across OSes and not degrade performance.
- Needs coordination with undo/redo and transaction logging features.
