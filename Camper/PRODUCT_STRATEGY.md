# Camper Product Strategy

**READ THIS FIRST**: GPT-5 generated a comprehensive product strategy report for Camper.

## How to Access

```bash
forest node read e860b1c3
```

Or view in Forest's knowledge base as node `e860b1c3`.

## Report Summary

**Title**: "What Humans Actually Want: A Human-First Product Strategy for Camper (Built on Forest)"

**Generated**: 2025-10-21
**Cost**: $0.02 (GPT-5 high reasoning)
**Length**: ~2,424 words

## Key Insights

### Core Principle
> "Build the Practice, Not the Graph. The graph is the engine; the practice is the product."

### Strategic Focus Areas

1. **Three-Second Capture** - Every primary action <2 seconds
2. **Review Mode Over Dashboards** - Calm triage, not information overload
3. **Editor-First Experience** - People live in the editor
4. **Human-in-the-Loop Intelligence** - Forest proposes, humans decide
5. **Rhythmic Workflows** - Daily, weekly, monthly patterns

### What NOT to Build

- ❌ Heavy PM suite (Gantt charts, sprints)
- ❌ Real-time collaboration as core feature
- ❌ Notion-like database engine
- ❌ Flashy graph dashboard
- ❌ Auto-rewriting notes without confirmation

### The Camper Advantage

Forest handles graph intelligence (embeddings, auto-linking, scoring). This frees Camper to focus entirely on human workflows that competitors can't match because they conflate the graph layer with the interface layer.

## Three-Phase Roadmap

**Phase 1 (0-3mo)**: Quick capture, daily notes, Review Mode v1, editor experience
**Phase 2 (3-6mo)**: Tasks, meeting briefings, context panel, AI-assisted extraction
**Phase 3 (6-9mo)**: Automations, integrations (Readwise/Omnivore), lightweight sharing

## Success Metrics

- Time-to-capture < 2 seconds
- Triage throughput (inbox zero in ~12 minutes)
- Retrieval success within 10 seconds
- **Forest proposal acceptance rate** (trust indicator)
- 4-week retention
