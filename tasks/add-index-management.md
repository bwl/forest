# Task: Add Index Management and Performance Controls

## Objective
Provide commands and infrastructure for rebuilding specific indexes, running background jobs, and monitoring index health to improve performance.

## Key Deliverables
- Specification for index management commands (e.g., `admin.reindex --nodes --edges`).
- Implementation of background job queue or asynchronous processing where needed.
- Monitoring hooks/logs to surface index status and performance metrics.
- Documentation on when and how to use reindexing tools.
- Tests verifying reindex operations complete successfully and safely.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Discovery**
   - Catalog existing indexes and performance bottlenecks.
   - Identify long-running operations suitable for background processing.
2. **Design**
   - Define command syntax, options, and safety checks (dry runs, progress reporting).
   - Determine concurrency model (synchronous vs queued jobs).
3. **Implementation**
   - Implement reindex commands, job scheduling, and status reporting.
   - Ensure operations are interruptible and resumable when possible.
4. **Testing**
   - Write integration tests for reindex scenarios and failure recovery.
5. **Documentation**
   - Update admin guides with usage instructions and best practices.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Reindexing may require exclusive DB access; coordinate with locking safeguards.
- Need to prevent data corruption if operations are interrupted.
