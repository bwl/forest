# Task: Document and Standardize Exit Codes

## Objective
Define and document consistent exit statuses for CLI commands to improve scriptability and automation reliability.

## Key Deliverables
- Exit code policy covering success, no-result, validation errors, and system failures.
- Implementation updates ensuring commands return the documented codes (e.g., search returning 2 when no results).
- Automated tests checking exit codes for representative scenarios.
- Documentation updates (help text, reference tables) describing exit statuses.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Assessment**
   - Audit current exit code usage across commands.
2. **Design**
   - Create a mapping of exit codes to conditions, aligning with Unix conventions.
   - Decide on error handling patterns to produce consistent codes.
3. **Implementation**
   - Update command handlers and error wrappers to emit standardized codes.
4. **Testing**
   - Add CLI-level tests verifying exit codes for success, no-result, and failure cases.
5. **Documentation**
   - Publish exit code table in docs and include notes in `--help` where relevant.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Changes may affect existing scripts relying on default exit codes; communicate clearly during rollout.
