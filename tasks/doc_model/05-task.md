# Task 05: Documentation, Tooling, and Rollout

**Status:** âœ… Completed

---

## Deliverables

- `docs/document-model.md` explains the canonical document lifecycle, schema, editing workflow, error recovery, and includes a rollout checklist with verification steps.
- CLI logs now surface document-version summaries (`node edit` + `node refresh`) so operators can monitor canonical updates in production.
- Added `bun test` wiring with an initial editor-buffer test (`src/cli/shared/__tests__/document-session.spec.ts`).
- README already reflected the `node edit` / `node refresh` split (Task 03); no further CLI help changes required.

## Verification

- Commands: `bun run lint`, `bun test`.
- Manual smoke: inspected generated editor buffer output; document refresh now reports canonical updates in-console.

## Follow-up

- Expand automated coverage to include round-tripping edited buffers once we expose a public helper for parsing.
- Future work will add support for segment creation/deletion and richer test fixtures (integration tests against a temp SQLite db).
