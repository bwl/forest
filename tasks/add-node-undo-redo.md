# Task: Add Undo/Redo for Node Edits

## Objective
Provide transaction logging and undo/redo capabilities for node edits to enhance safety and recoverability.

## Key Deliverables
- Design for transaction log schema capturing node edit history.
- CLI/API commands for undoing and redoing recent edits.
- UI/UX cues indicating undo availability and limitations.
- Documentation on how undo/redo works and retention policies.
- Tests covering edge cases (multiple edits, conflicts, attachment updates).

## Implementation Plan
1. **Design**
   - Determine granularity of logged events and storage location.
   - Define retention window and cleanup strategies.
2. **Implementation**
   - Extend persistence layer to record edit events and metadata.
   - Implement undo/redo commands that replay or revert changes safely.
3. **Integration**
   - Ensure interaction with concurrency safeguards and edge moderation workflows.
4. **Testing**
   - Add unit/integration tests simulating complex edit sequences.
5. **Documentation**
   - Update docs and CLI help with instructions and limitations.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Requires robust concurrency handling to avoid conflicting undo operations.
- Storage overhead for detailed logs must be monitored.
