## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-22

### Added

#### Git-Style Node References & Progressive IDs
- **Progressive UUID abbreviation** - IDs now display with minimum length needed for uniqueness ([7e603d1](https://github.com/bwl/forest/commit/7e603d1), [039aa44](https://github.com/bwl/forest/commit/039aa44))
  - Starts at 4 characters, grows as needed
  - Backward compatible: all existing 8-char and full UUIDs still work
  - `formatNodeIdProgressive()` replaces fixed 8-char display
- **Recency references** - Git-style `HEAD~N` syntax for recent nodes ([7e603d1](https://github.com/bwl/forest/commit/7e603d1))
  - `@` or `@0` - Most recently updated node
  - `@1`, `@2`, etc. - Second, third most recent
  - Works across all commands: `forest node read @`, `forest node link @ @1`
- **Tag search references** - Find nodes by tag ([7e603d1](https://github.com/bwl/forest/commit/7e603d1))
  - `#typescript` - Node tagged with 'typescript'
  - Must match unique node or shows disambiguation
- **Title search references** - Find nodes by title substring ([7e603d1](https://github.com/bwl/forest/commit/7e603d1))
  - Quoted strings match against node titles
  - Must be unique or shows Git-style disambiguation
- **Shell completions** - Tab completion for bash and zsh ([7e603d1](https://github.com/bwl/forest/commit/7e603d1))
  - `completions/forest.bash` and `completions/forest.zsh`
  - Supports commands, flags, and recency references
