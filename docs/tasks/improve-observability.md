# Task: Improve Observability and Logging Options

## Objective
Provide enhanced logging verbosity controls, structured logs, and timing metrics to aid debugging and production monitoring.

## Key Deliverables
- Logging strategy with support for `--verbose`, `--quiet`, and `--log-format` options (text/json).
- Implementation of timing metrics flag (`--time`) to report command durations.
- Structured log output compatible with log aggregation tools.
- Documentation outlining logging levels, formats, and usage patterns.
- Tests ensuring logging options interact correctly across commands.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Design**
   - Review current logging approach and identify gaps.
   - Define logging levels and format schemas.
2. **Implementation**
   - Update logging utilities to respect global flags and produce structured output.
   - Integrate timing measurements in the command execution pipeline.
3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for logging helpers and integration tests verifying flag behavior.
4. **Documentation**
   - Update docs with logging configuration examples and troubleshooting tips.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Structured logging must not break existing plain-text expectations without opt-in.
