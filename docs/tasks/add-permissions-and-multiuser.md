# Task: Implement Permissions and Multiuser Support

## Objective
Add ownership, access control lists (ACLs), and audit trails to support multiuser deployments of the Forest server.

## Key Deliverables
- Security model defining user identities, roles, and permissions.
- Database schema updates for ownership metadata and ACL tables.
- API/CLI enforcement of permissions on read/write operations.
- Audit logging for critical actions.
- Documentation describing multiuser configuration, onboarding, and admin workflows.
- Tests covering permission checks and auditing.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Design**
   - Define user model (local accounts, SSO integration, etc.) and permission granularity.
   - Outline migration steps for existing single-user data.
2. **Implementation**
   - Update database and data access layers to incorporate ownership and ACL checks.
   - Integrate authentication/authorization with serve security features.
3. **Testing**
   - Add unit/integration tests for permission enforcement and audit logging.
4. **Documentation**
   - Provide admin guides for managing users, roles, and access policies.
5. **Rollout**
   - Plan migration tooling and communication for existing deployments.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Depends on foundational auth support from serve security task.
- Introduces complexity in data model; requires careful migration strategy.
