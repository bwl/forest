# Awesome Idea: The Merchant's Gambit - Dynamic Pricing AI

## Concept

Transform the economy from static shop lists into a living, breathing market ecosystem. Each merchant operates as an intelligent economic agent with memory, preferences, and market awareness. Prices fluctuate based on supply/demand, regional events, your trading history, and merchant relationships. This creates opportunities for market manipulation, trade route optimization, and economic warfare while making every transaction meaningful.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Algorithm

Each merchant maintains several data points that influence their prices:

**Regional Supply/Demand:**
- Track quantities of each item type bought/sold in the region over time
- High demand (lots of buying) increases prices, high supply (lots of selling) decreases them
- `price_modifier = base_price * (demand_factor / supply_factor) * scarcity_multiplier`

**Personal Trading History:**
- Merchants remember your past transactions and adjust accordingly
- Frequent customers get gradual discounts (up to 15%)
- Players who only sell to them (never buy) face price penalties
- Haggling success/failure affects future negotiations

**Market Intelligence Network:**
- Merchants share information about price trends with allied traders
- Caravan networks spread market data between distant settlements
- Information travels at realistic speeds, creating arbitrage opportunities

### 2. Merchant Personality System

Each merchant has distinct traits that affect their economic behavior:

**Archetype Examples:**
- **The Opportunist:** Rapidly adjusts prices based on current events, willing to price-gouge during crises
- **The Steady Dealer:** Stable prices but slower to adapt, reliable but less profitable
- **The Risk-Taker:** Invests in rare/experimental goods, high prices but unique inventory
- **The Volume Trader:** Prefers bulk transactions, gives quantity discounts
- **The Specialist:** Expert in one category (weapons/potions), premium prices but superior quality

**Relationship Modifiers:**
- **Reputation Tracking:** Merchants spread word about reliable/problematic customers
- **Faction Allegiances:** Allied faction merchants give discounts, enemies charge premiums
- **Personal Vendettas:** Merchants who feel cheated may refuse service or set traps

### 3. Market Manipulation Opportunities

**Cornering Markets:**
- Buy up all iron ore in mining regions during winter when supply is low
- Transport to weapon-hungry war zones for massive profits
- Risk: Other traders notice and compete, or find alternative suppliers

**Information Arbitrage:**
- Learn about upcoming conflicts before merchants do
- Pre-position supplies where they'll be needed
- Spread false rumors to manipulate demand (but face consequences if discovered)

**Supply Chain Warfare:**
- Disrupt competitor trade routes through banditry or politics
- Establish exclusive deals with producers
- Create artificial scarcity through hoarding

### 4. Event-Driven Price Volatility

**Military Conflicts:**
- Weapon/armor prices spike in war zones
- Food becomes precious during sieges
- Healing items command premium during battles

**Natural Disasters:**
- Floods destroy crop harvests, food prices soar
- Mine collapses reduce metal supply
- Plague outbreaks increase demand for medicines

**Seasonal Fluctuations:**
- Furs valuable in winter, ice in summer
- Preserved foods more expensive before long journeys
- Certain magical components only available during specific seasons

## Advanced Features

### 5. The Merchant's Gambit Meta-Game

### 6. Reputation & Relationship Web

- Word spreads through merchant networks at realistic speeds
- Build or destroy reputations through consistent behavior

**Economic Espionage:**
- Bribe merchants for information about competitor activities
- Plant false information to manipulate market sentiment

## Gameplay & Narrative Impact

**Strategic Layer Integration:**
- Economic success enables military expansion and political influence

- Choices have long-term consequences that ripple through the economy
- Failed economic strategies can cripple entire playthroughs

**Emergent Storytelling:**
- Personal rivalries with merchant houses create ongoing narrative tension
- Economic boom/bust cycles tell stories of civilizations rising and falling
- Player actions create legends (positive or negative) that persist across characters

## Implementation Sketch

**Data Structures:**
```toml
# merchants.toml
[merchant."Iron_Hills_Blacksmith"]
personality = "steady_dealer"
specialties = ["weapons", "armor"]
base_reputation = 50
faction_allegiance = "iron_hills_guild"
price_volatility = 0.2
memory_length_days = 30

# market_events.toml
[event."dragon_attack"]
triggers = ["dragon_spotted_nearby"]
price_modifiers = { weapons = 1.4, armor = 1.3, healing_potions = 1.8 }
duration_days = 14
```

**Systems Architecture:**
- `MarketSystem`: Runs daily/hourly to update prices based on supply/demand
- `MerchantRelationshipSystem`: Tracks individual relationships and reputation
- `TradeRouteSystem`: Manages established routes and their profitability  
- `MarketIntelligenceSystem`: Spreads information through merchant networks
- `EconomicEventSystem`: Triggers price volatility based on world events

**UI Components:**
- **Market Analysis Panel**: Shows price trends, supply/demand graphs
- **Reputation Tracker**: Displays standing with different merchant factions
- **Trade Route Planner**: Visual map interface for establishing routes
- **Merchant Personality Profiles**: Shows each merchant's quirks and preferences

This system transforms simple buying/selling into a deep strategic game within the game, where economic mastery becomes as important as combat prowess for long-term success.
