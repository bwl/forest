# Awesome Idea: Living Dungeons & Architectural Evolution

## Concept

Dungeons are not static structures but living entities that grow, change, and evolve over time. Each dungeon has its own "personality" and "life cycle," responding to the actions of players and the passage of time. The architecture itself can shift, creating new challenges and opportunities for exploration.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Dungeon Personalities

*   **Living Constructs:** Each dungeon is a semi-sentient entity with its own desires, fears, and growth patterns.
*   **Personality Traits:**
    *   `The Greedy Vault` - Constantly tries to accumulate treasure, growing new chambers to store it
    *   `The Labyrinthine Mind` - Enjoys confusing visitors, constantly shifting its layout
    *   `The Protective Mother` - Adapts to defend its inhabitants, growing stronger barriers when threatened
    *   `The Dying Giant` - Slowly decays, with sections becoming unstable and dangerous
*   **Mood States:** Dungeons can be in different emotional states (content, angry, frightened, curious) that affect their behavior.

### 2. Architectural Growth

*   **Organic Expansion:** Dungeons grow new rooms, corridors, and features over time, like living organisms.
*   **Adaptive Design:** The dungeon's architecture responds to what happens within it:
    *   Areas of frequent combat develop reinforced walls and weapon racks
    *   Sections where players frequently get lost grow more complex mazes
    *   Rooms where treasure is left accumulate additional storage spaces
*   **Seasonal Changes:** Dungeons change with the seasons, reflecting the world above:
    *   Winter: Dungeons become colder, with ice formations and frost-covered walls
    *   Spring: New growth appears, with moss, fungi, and even small plants
    *   Summer: Dungeons become hotter and more active, with increased monster activity
    *   Autumn: Dungeons take on a decaying appearance, with falling debris and dying vegetation

### 3. Dungeon Life Cycle

*   **Birth:** New dungeons are "born" when magical energies coalesce around significant events or powerful artifacts.
*   **Youth:** Young dungeons are unstable and unpredictable, with rapidly changing layouts and weak defenses.
*   **Maturity:** Mature dungeons have stable personalities and established layouts, but continue to grow slowly.
*   **Old Age:** Ancient dungeons become incredibly complex but also fragile, with sections that may collapse.
*   **Death:** When a dungeon dies, it leaves behind a "fossil" - a static, but incredibly valuable, structure filled with ancient treasures.

### 4. Player Interaction Effects

*   **Memory Imprints:** Dungeons "remember" significant events and players, which can influence future visits:
    *   A player who frequently uses fire magic might find a dungeon growing more fire-resistant features
    *   A player who consistently avoids combat might find easier, less defended paths
*   **Symbiotic Relationships:** Players can form relationships with dungeons:
    *   Becoming a "Dungeon Guardian" grants powerful benefits but ties the player to the dungeon's location
    *   Negotiating with a dungeon's personality can lead to mutually beneficial arrangements
*   **Dungeon Taming:** Powerful players can partially "tame" dungeons, making them more predictable and gaining control over some aspects of their growth.

### 5. Dungeon Ecology

*   **Internal Ecosystems:** Dungeons develop complex internal ecosystems with predator-prey relationships between monsters.
*   **Resource Cycles:** Dungeons process resources (treasure, corpses, magical energy) to fuel their growth.
*   **Parasitic Dungeons:** Some dungeons are parasites on others, slowly consuming them from within.
*   **Symbiotic Dungeons:** Certain dungeons form beneficial relationships, exchanging resources and even sharing inhabitants.

## Gameplay & Narrative Impact

*   **Replayability:** No two visits to a dungeon are exactly alike, encouraging repeated exploration.
*   **Meaningful Consequences:** Player actions have lasting effects on the world's geography.
*   **Narrative Depth:** Dungeons become characters in their own right, with stories and relationships.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Players must consider how their actions will affect dungeon evolution when making decisions.

## Implementation Sketch

*   **Data:** Dungeons have personality traits, life stages, and growth patterns defined in `living_dungeons.toml`.
*   **Systems:** Dungeon growth system runs periodically, modifying layouts based on personality and history. Mood system tracks emotional states.
*   **UI:** Special "Dungeon Compendium" shows known information about each dungeon's personality and current state.
