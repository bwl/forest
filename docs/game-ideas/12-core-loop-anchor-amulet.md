# Core Progression: The Anchor Amulet & The Two-Phase Game

## Concept

This document outlines the central meta-progression loop of the game, which is divided into two distinct phases. The first phase is a tightly-scoped, traditional roguelike experience. The second phase, unlocked by the player's success, opens into a persistent grand-strategy world that serves as a platform for further roguelike adventures.

## Phase 1: The Trial (Chapter 1)

*   **Gameplay:** A pure, high-stakes survival experience. The player is alone, resources are scarce, and every decision matters.
*   **The Threat:** Permadeath is the primary antagonist. If the player dies, their run is over, and they must start again from the beginning.
*   **The Goal:** The player's objective is to complete the introductory quest line, culminating in the lighting of a mysterious beacon. This act serves as their final test.

## The Turning Point: The Anchor Amulet

Upon lighting the beacon, the player forges a permanent, metaphysical link between their soul and their camp. This link is embodied by a new, unique item: **The Anchor Amulet**.

*   **Narrative Framing:** The beacon's fire doesn't just send a signal; it brands the player's essence to their chosen home. The Amulet is a physical manifestation of this bond. You are no longer just a wanderer; you are a permanent fixture of this world.
*   **New Mechanic: The Anchor Respawn:** With the Amulet equipped, death is no longer the end. When the player's health reaches zero in the overworld or in standard dungeons, they respawn at their camp.
*   **The Cost of Death:** Respawning is not free. It comes with significant penalties that make death a major setback to be avoided:
    *   **Time Passes:** A significant amount of in-game time passes (e.g., 3-5 days). During this time, the world moves on without you. Faction armies will have advanced, world events will have progressed, and timed quests may have failed.
    *   **Resource Loss:** The player might drop a portion of their carried resources at their place of death, forcing a "corpse run" to retrieve them.
    *   **Durability Damage:** All equipped gear suffers a major durability hit.

## Phase 2: The Persistent World (Chapters 2-5)

*   **The Overworld as a Platform:** With the threat of permanent game-over removed, the overworld becomes a grand strategic map. It is a persistent platform from which the player launches expeditions, manages their faction, and wages war.
*   **The New Failure State:** The primary failure state is no longer personal death, but strategic loss. Losing a key territory, failing to stop a rival faction, or bankrupting your kingdom are the new stakes.
*   **Meta-Progression:** The player's long-term progression is now tied to exploring the overworld and completing roguelike adventures within it. The rewards from these adventures (e.g., rare materials, faction alliances, unique items) are what allow the player to achieve their larger goals, such as building a boat to reach a new continent, or forging the weapons needed to arm an army.

### High-Stakes Adventures: Amulet Suppression Zones

To ensure the high-stakes tension of a true roguelike is never lost, certain deep and dangerous locations are **Amulet Suppression Zones**.

*   **Mechanic:** Upon entering these dungeons (e.g., The Gauntlet, the Angband/Rogue POIs, the final lair of a world boss), the Anchor Amulet grows cold and inert. A clear message is displayed: `The ancient power in this place overwhelms your Amulet. If you fall here, there will be no return.`
*   **The Return of Permadeath:** Inside these zones, death is permanent for that specific run. The player is ejected from the dungeon, losing all progress, items, and discoveries made within it. They still respawn at their camp, but the expedition is a total failure.
*   **The Ultimate Risk/Reward:** These zones offer the greatest rewards in the game—legendary artifacts, unique crafting materials, major story revelations—but demand flawless play. This creates a perfect blend of persistent-world strategy and high-stakes, focused roguelike delving.
