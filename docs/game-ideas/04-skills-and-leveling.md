## Prompt:
i’d like to have long term skill grinds like runescape — how could i implement things like woodcutting, mining, fishing

## Response:
Thought for 8s

For a system like RuneScape's skill grinds, I'd focus on resource nodes with tiered depletion and respawn mechanics, systems for actions generating XP or items, and varying success chances per task. Players could engage AFK or actively, with rewards, bonuses, and anti-exploit measures such as diminishing returns. Components should include looping actions, timers, and state machines for skill progression, incorporating mastery, events, contracts, and a loot system integrated with quests. Balancing equations for XP and rewards will refine the design.

Done

heck yes — let’s bolt a RuneScape-style “big grind” layer onto your roguelike with **woodcutting, mining, fishing** that fits your ECS + overworld/POI world.

Below is a **systems-first** design you can ship: components, loops, math, data tables, and anti-cheese—all reusable for any gathering skill.

* * *

Core loop (shared across skills)
================================

1.  **Find Node** (tree/rock/fishing spot) →
2.  **Begin Action** (checks: skill, tool, occupancy) →
3.  **Work Ticks** (every N turns/seconds) →
4.  **Success Rolls** produce **resource items** + **Skill XP** →
5.  **Node Depletion** → **Respawn** after a delay →
6.  Optional **Processing** (sawmill, smelting, cooking) for more XP + value

Design goals: AFK-friendly baseline, **active bonus** path (tiny inputs give 10–30% better XP/hr), long-term mastery, and clean ECS decoupling.

* * *

ECS: components (minimal, reusable)
===================================

**Actors**

*   `SkillLevels { map<SkillId,int>, virtual:int? }` // woodcutting, mining, fishing…
*   `Tool { toolKind, tier:int, quality:0..3 }` // axe, pick, rod; tier gates content
*   `Haste { pct }` // buffs from Power system
*   `Inventory { slots, weight }`
*   `Fatigue { 0..100 }` // soft-anti-bot and pacing

**World nodes**

*   `ResourceNode { kind, tier:int, hp:int, maxHp, levelReq:int }`
*   `NodeYield { itemId, dice:XdY+Z, xpPer, rareTableId? }`
*   `Respawn { meanSeconds, jitterPct, dueAt? }`
*   `Occupancy { maxWorkers:int, current:int }`
*   `Hotspot { bonusXpPct, bonusRatePct }` // POI events, weather, moons
*   `AntiFarm { diminishingKey, scale }` // reduces gains if hammered

**Work session**

*   `GatheringAction { actor, node, skillId, tickPeriod, timeLeft, successChance, rollsPerTick }`
*   `ActionMode { mode:AFK|Active, bonus:0..0.3 }` // set by player; Active can proc microgames
*   `CoolDown { until }` // per-node or per-actor cooldown (optional)

**Economy / processing**

*   `Processor { recipeTableId }` // sawmill, furnace, smoker
*   `Recipe { input[], output[], xp, time }`

All **bonuses** (gear, auras, food, boons) come in via your existing **Power** system as stat mods: `+gather.success`, `+gather.speed`, `+gather.rare`, `+skill.xp`.

* * * 

Systems
=======

*   **StartGatherSystem**: validates tool/level, reserves `Occupancy`, builds `GatheringAction`.
*   **GatherTickSystem** (fires every game tick):
    *   For each `GatheringAction`, do `rollsPerTick` Bernoulli trials with `successChance`.
    *   On success: give `NodeYield` items + XP; reduce `node.hp`.
    *   If `node.hp<=0`: despawn node; schedule `Respawn`.
*   **RespawnSystem**: Poisson/normal-jitter respawn of nodes.
*   **ProcessingSystem**: consumes inputs, outputs refined goods + XP.
*   **FatigueSystem**: ramps a small penalty during excessive continuous farming; resets while doing other things/quests.
*   **AntiFarmSystem**: per-node diminishing returns by `(1 / (1+k*recentInteractions))`.
*   **ActiveBonusSystem** (optional): tiny timing/aim microgame events that, when hit, apply `ActionMode.bonus`.

* * * 

Math (simple, durable)
======================

**Attempt timing**

```
tick_period = base_period[node.kind,tier] * (1 - haste_pct) * fatigue_mult
rolls_per_tick = 1 + multiroll_bonuses                           // e.g., 1 base, +1 from 2H tools
```

**Success chance** (one check per roll)

```
Δtier   = tool.tier - node.tier
Δlevel  = skill_level - node.levelReq
success = clamp( base[node.kind] 
                 + 0.12*Δtier 
                 + curve(Δlevel; k=0.06) 
                 + additive_bonuses
                 , 0.05, 0.95)
```

`curve(x;k)=1 - exp(-k*max(0,x))` for soft diminishing returns.

**XP per success**

```
xp = node.baseXP * (1 + quality*0.05) * (1 + hotspot.bonusXpPct) * (1 + mode_bonus) * (1 + power_xp_bonus)
```

**Rare table chance**

```
pRare = baseRare[node.kind,tier] * (1 + rare_bonus) * hotspot.rareMult
```

**Respawn**

```
dueAt = now + Normal(mean = respawn.meanSeconds, sd = mean*jitterPct)
```

Scale `meanSeconds` up with population in area to reduce clustering.

**Fatigue**

```
fatigue += tick_period * 0.003  (cap 100)
fatigue_mult = 1 + 0.002 * fatigue     // at 100 fatigue: ~+20% action time
```

(Keep this gentle, mostly anti-bot; show a “stretch” hint.)

**XP curve (RuneScape-ish)**  
Use a near-exponential:

```
xpForLevel(L) = floor( (L-1)^3 * A + (L-1)^2 * B + (L-1)*C )   // or OSRS table
```

Or copy OSRS cumulative XP (fast to tune): 1→99 ≈ 13,034,431.

Data examples
=============

### Tiers

| Tier | Tool | Node (wood) | Node (mining) | Node (fishing) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Crude | Oak | Copper | River Trout |
| 2 | Iron | Birch | Tin/Coal | Lake Perch |
| 3 | Steel | Pine | Iron | Pike |
| 4 | Dwarven | Maple | Mithril | Salmon |
| 5 | Elven | Yew | Adamant | Sturgeon |
| 6 | Arcane | Redwood | Orichalcum | Leviathan bait |

### Node YAML (woodcutting)

```yaml
id: tree_redwood_t5
ResourceNode: { kind: "Wood", tier: 5, hp: 8, maxHp: 8, levelReq: 60 }
NodeYield:    { itemId: "log_redwood", dice: "1d2", xpPer: 150, rareTableId: "rt_wood_t5" }
Respawn:      { meanSeconds: 120, jitterPct: 0.25 }
Occupancy:    { maxWorkers: 1 }
```

### Tool

```yaml
id: axe_dwarven_t4
Tool: { toolKind: "Axe", tier: 4, quality: 1 }
```

### Rare table (shared format with your loot system)

```yaml
id: rt_wood_t5
entries:
  - { kind: "Bundle", refId: "BND_Potion_Haste_S", weight: 5 }     # ties into Power system
  - { kind: "Item",   refId: "nest_owl",             weight: 2 }
  - { kind: "Item",   refId: "pet_seed_spriggan",    weight: 0.1 } # ultra rare cosmetic/pet
```

* * * 

Pseudocode (start → tick)
=========================

```python
def try_start_gather(actor, node):
    skill = actor.SkillLevels["Woodcutting"]
    tool  = best_tool(actor, "Axe")
    assert tool and tool.tier >= 1
    if skill < node.levelReq: return fail("Too low level")
    if node.Occupancy.current >= node.Occupancy.maxWorkers: return fail("Busy")

    node.Occupancy.current += 1
    act = GatheringAction(
        actor=actor, node=node, skillId="Woodcutting",
        tickPeriod = base_period["Wood", node.tier] * haste_mult(actor) * fatigue_mult(actor),
        successChance = success_prob(actor, node, tool),
        rollsPerTick = 1 + multiroll(actor, tool),
        timeLeft = session_cap(actor)  # optional AFK cap
    )
    actor.add(act)

def on_gather_tick(act, dt):
    act.elapsed += dt
    if act.elapsed < act.tickPeriod: return
    act.elapsed -= act.tickPeriod
    for _ in range(act.rollsPerTick):
        if rng()<act.successChance:
            qty = roll(act.node.NodeYield.dice)
            grant_item(act.actor, act.node.NodeYield.itemId, qty)
            grant_xp(act.actor, act.skillId, xp_for(act))
            act.node.ResourceNode.hp -= 1
            maybe_roll_rare(act)
    if act.node.ResourceNode.hp <= 0:
        schedule_respawn(act.node)
        stop_action(act)
```

* * * 

Active vs AFK
=============

*   **AFK mode**: no inputs; baseline XP/hr.
*   **Active mode**: tiny prompts (e.g., time a chop “sweet spot”, align pick angle, hook timing):
    *   +10–30% success and/or extra roll on perfect input.
    *   No failure punishment beyond opportunity cost.
    *   Toggle anytime (respect accessibility: allow “always AFK” builds).

* * * 

Long-term progression & retention
=================================

*   **Mastery tracks** per node family (e.g., _Yew Mastery 0–100_) that unlock cosmetics, animations, tiny passive boosts.
*   **Contracts** (dailies/POIs): “Deliver 40 coal to the Dwarf Forge” for bulk XP + gold.
*   **Collections** (logbook): first-time catch/mine/chop awards XP burst + title.
*   **Prestige** (optional): reset a skill at cap for a gilded trim + 1% global speed (stacking softly).
*   **Seasonal/world events**: region hotspots with `Hotspot{bonusXpPct}`; your POI system can flip these on/off.

* * * 

Economy & sinks
===============

*   Wood → planks (sawmill fee), Mining → ores → bars (coal sink), Fishing → raw → cooked (fuel sink).
*   Tools repair or consumable bait/lures as **gold sinks**.
*   Encumbrance or bank trips keep logistics interesting; carts & beasts of burden unlock later.

* * * 

Anti-exploit / fairness
=======================

*   **Occupancy** and **Respawn jitter** prevent perfect bot loops.
*   **AntiFarm** per node key dampens XP/gold when a single tile is hammered continuously.
*   **Fatigue** is soft and recoverable; don’t hard lock players.
*   Server-side RNG & action pacing; validate tool/level on tick to stop packet spam.
*   Short **AFK session caps** per action (e.g., 5–10 min) so players reposition occasionally—good for roguelike pacing.

* * * 

How it ties into your existing systems
======================================

*   **Items** yielded are normal items; refinements use your **Recipe/Processor** stations (forges, smokers) placed as POIs.
*   All boosts (outfits, food, potions, auras) are **PowerBundles** with tags like `gather.speed`, `gather.rare`, `skill.xp`.
*   Rare tables and hotspot bonuses reuse the **LootContext** you already have (region, floor, poiTags).

* * * 

Quick starter defaults
======================

*   Base periods: Wood 3.0s, Mining 4.0s, Fishing 3.5s (adjust for turn length).
*   Base success: Wood .55, Mining .50, Fishing .60 at equal tier/level.
*   Rare base: 1:256 at tier1, scales to 1:1024 at top unless buffed.
*   XP tables: copy OSRS levels or use `(L^3)*0.5` cumulative for a “long but fair” curve.
*   Respawn means: T1 20s → T6 120s, ±25% jitter.

If you want, I can turn this into concrete TypeScript/Rust ECS structs and a tiny dataset for one skill so you can profile XP/hr and tune numbers quickly.

## Prompt:
can you articulate the OSRS leveling formula? it’s documented online

## Response:
Certainly! Here’s the authentic leveling formula used in Old School RuneScape (OSRS), so you can replicate that iconic long‑grind curve:

* * * 

OSRS Experience Formula
-----------------------

OSRS uses the following **experience calculation** to determine how much XP is required to reach level _L_:

 $\text{Experience}(L) = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} \left( i + 300 \times 2^{\frac{i}{7}} \right) \right\rfloor$ 

*   The summation runs from levels 1 up to _L−1_.
*   For each _i_, you compute:
    *    $i + 300 \times 2^{(i/7)}$ 
*   Then sum all values, divide by 4, and take the **floor**.  
    [Old School Tools+9Old School RuneScape Wiki+9Reddit+9](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Experience?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * * 

How It Works in Practice
------------------------

This formula yields the following XP progression (total XP required per level), matching the OSRS leveling curve:

| Level | Total XP |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 83 |
| 3 | 174 |
| 4 | 276 |
| ... | ... |
| 99 | 13,034,431 |

And the XP needed from one level to the next grows roughly **10.4%** each level, consistent with exponential growth of factor  $2^{1/7} \approx 1.10409$ .

* * * 

Supporting Explanation (from StackOverflow)
-------------------------------------------

A practical C-style implementation (source: StackOverflow) loops and replicates the formula exactly:

```c
int xp = 0;
for(int i = 1; i < level; i++) {
    xp += floor(i + 300 * pow(2.0, i / 7.0));
}
int result = floor(xp / 4);
```

This yields the classic 83 XP for level 2, 174 XP for level 3, and so on. [Old School Tools+9Stack Overflow+9Reddit+9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28994618/math-formula-in-c-for-runescape-experience?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Summary
-------

*   **Formula**:  
     $\text{XP}(L) = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{L-1} \left( i + 300 \times 2^{i/7} \right) \right\rfloor$
*   **Growth**:
    *   XP between levels increases by about **10.4% per level**.

Let me know if you'd like some Swift/Rust/TypeScript code to plug it right into your system, or even a table or function that works up to level 120!

## Prompt:
what skills do you think would
translate well to an Adom / Angband type of epic scale rogue game

## Response:
nice question — if you’re aiming for an **epic-scale roguelike** in the ADOM/Angband lineage (big overworld, many dungeons, grindy but flavorful progression), you can take inspiration from RuneScape-style “long grinds,” but filter them through the _roguelike loop_ (turn-based, permadeath pressure, exploration focus).

here’s a set of skills that fit naturally into such a world:

* * * 

🔨 Resource / Gathering Skills
------------------------------

These add long-term goals and tie into economy, crafting, and survival:

*   **Mining** → ores, gems, dungeon stone (fuel smithing, spell reagents, quest unlocks).
*   **Woodcutting** → timber, herbs from groves, rune-carved branches (scrolls, fletching).
*   **Fishing** → steady food + rare magical catches; fits rivers/lakes/underground pools.
*   **Foraging / Herbalism** → mushrooms, roots, herbs → potions, poisons, cooking.
*   **Hunting / Trapping** → pelts, bones, rare beast parts; doubles as a combat-adjacent grind.

* * * 

⚔️ Combat / Adventuring Skills
------------------------------

Anchor the classic Angband dungeon crawl with gradual depth mastery:

*   **Weapon Mastery (per class)** → swords, axes, polearms, bows, slings.
*   **Armor Use / Shielding** → reduces penalties, unlocks special blocks.
*   **Stealth** → reduces noise, chance to sneak-attack; ties into dungeon survival.
*   **Magic Schools** (Fire, Shadow, Divination, Nature) → deep XP sinks, add rare spell unlocks.
*   **Tactics** → improves positioning, flanking bonuses, turn economy.

* * * 

🛠️ Crafting / Utility Skills
-----------------------------

Give long-grind “side economies” without distracting from permadeath loop:

*   **Smithing / Fletching / Runecrafting** → weapons, arrows, scrolls, runes.
*   **Cooking / Brewing** → food as buffs, potions, permanent brews.
*   **Enchanting** → affixes equipment with randomized **PowerBundles** (fits your ECS).
*   **Construction** (long-term) → temporary camps, bridges, traps in overworld.

* * * 

🌍 World Interaction Skills
---------------------------

Good for an **epic scale** roguelike that spans overworld + multiple dungeons:

*   **Survival** → reduces hunger, cold, environmental damage (deserts, swamps, ice).
*   **Climbing / Swimming** → access hidden overworld areas, alt routes.
*   **Navigation / Cartography** → better automaps, dungeon awareness, fewer ambushes.
*   **Lore / Appraisal** → faster identification of items, monsters, and ruins (ties directly to your unidentified system).
*   **Faith / Piety** → unlocks god favors, miracles, or divine crafting.

* * * 

🏆 Meta-Skills (long grind anchors)
-----------------------------------

If you want a **RuneScape-scale timesink** in a permadeath roguelike, these give meaning across runs:

*   **Reputation / Faction Standing** → grind with dwarves, elves, guilds, temples; persists across worlds or characters.
*   **Masteries** → track cumulative XP (e.g., “You’ve chopped 10,000 trees across lifetimes” → small legacy boon).
*   **Epic Challenges** → special skill tracks (e.g., _Demon Slayer_, _Dragon Hunter_) that grow as you kill certain bosses across runs.

* * * 

Design notes (why these work in roguelike structure)
---------------------------------------------------

*   **Exploration tie-in:** skills aren’t idle grinds — they open routes, unlock loot, and flavor new regions (mining → dwarven halls, woodcutting → fae groves).
*   **RNG synergy:** resource skills interact with your loot/Power system; ores/herbs → affix or potion bundles.
*   **Risk vs grind:** unlike RuneScape, every “grind” in roguelikes is threatened by hunger, wandering monsters, or limited turns — so progress is earned under pressure.
*   **Legacy option:** you can make some skills meta-persistent (like ADOM talents or DCSS background aptitudes) if you want longer horizons.

* * * 

👉 if you want, I can sketch out **concrete XP curves & action loops** for a few of these (say, Mining and Lore/Appraisal) using the OSRS leveling formula you asked about, but tuned to roguelike pacing.

would you like me to go deeper into **which of these should be _per-run only_** vs **which could persist across multiple runs** (meta progression)?
